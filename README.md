# Prediction-High-Traffic-Recipes-For-Tasty-Bytes
## Overview

This project aims to predict which recipes will drive high traffic to the Tasty Bytes website, a recipe and meal planning service. By leveraging data science, we help the product team select homepage recipes that increase traffic by up to 40%, boosting subscriptions. The goal is to correctly predict high-traffic recipes 80% of the time while minimizing the display of unpopular ones.

The dataset includes 947 recipes with nutritional data, categories, servings, and traffic labels. We performed data validation, exploratory analysis, and built two models—Logistic Regression and Random Forest—to classify recipes as high or low traffic. The Random Forest model achieved a precision of 78%, recall of 80%, and accuracy of 75%, meeting the business target.
